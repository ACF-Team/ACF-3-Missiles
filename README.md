## About this repository

Armored Combat Framework 3: Missiles is just the adaptation of [ACF Missiles](https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-Missiles) to be used correctly with the newer, actively developed [Armored Combat Framework 3](https://github.com/Stooberton/ACF-3) aka ACF-3.

It's good to note this repository may not last for long, as the content of it is planned to be merged with ACF-3 in the near future.
